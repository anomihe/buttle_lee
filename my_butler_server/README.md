# Butler Lee - Server

The Serverpod backend for Butler Lee, handling AI processing, authentication, and reminder execution.

To run your server, you first need to start Postgres and Redis. It's easiest to do with Docker.

    docker compose up --build --detach

Then you can start the Serverpod server.

    dart bin/main.dart

When you are finished, you can shut down Serverpod with `Ctrl-C`, then stop Postgres and Redis.

    docker compose stop
